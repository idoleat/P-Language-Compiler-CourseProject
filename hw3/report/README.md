## How much time did you spend on this project

Maybe around 45 hrs. I didn't actually setup a timer so I don't have the precise answer. Maybe I can try next time.

## Project overview

### Make scanner return token value
if tokens in scanner has an actual value should be passed to parser, then use predefined `union` `yylval` to pass it.

### Non-terminals and Nodes
Mainly repeating these three steps:
* Give a non-terminal a type
* write actions for non-terminals
* Follow the AST Guild to implement nodes for actoins

I didn't use Visitor Pattern. Explained below.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

* Getting started is the hardest. While I was reading the document I was thinking oh man there are lots of work to do. So I keep checking the document and planning the way approaching this project. I am not experienced enough so I make it complicated easily. I started thinking I should checkout source files first, then I finally found that TA has done so much for us. bruh..... I should do it ealier next time.....

## Some other issues
* I thought I have time for both way of implemetation, so I go with normal way first. However I still got works from other courses to be finished in a pretty short time with an earlier deadline. Since I've started the normal way, I decided to finish it.

* I've been always interested in improving my c++ skill. I think it's a good chance. However I didn't get much time, so I wrote some dirty code and try to finish it as fast as possible. Nontheless I didn't even pass all the test cases. It's a shame. I hope I can avoid this in the next time.

## Feedback to T.A.s

Thanks for the well documented starter code and documents.
